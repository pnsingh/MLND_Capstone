This projects tests out various models to classify imdb reviews into positive and negative, based on a dataset curated by Mass et al.

The requirements are:
python2.7
numpy (1.12.0)
keras (v2.0.2)
matplotlib (v2.0.0)

The dataset can be loaded directly within keras
The basic data exploration can be found in : Data_Exp.ipynb

The implementation of the tf-idf along with the Multinomial Bayes Classifer can be found in : IMDB_tfidf.pynb

The implementation of a CNN model can be found in : IMDB_CNN.ipynb

The implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron model can be found in : IMDB_MLP.ipynb

The implementation of the LSTM model can be found in : IMDB_LSTM.ipynb
